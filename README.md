# PocketRPG
Unity project, creating a mobile RPG

Note: Still very much a prototype!?! so lacking a lot of code clean up and commenting ;) just want to progess a bit with ideas before fermenting code.

## ChangeLog

### 8 Nov
Started work on a Dialog Editor, a node based editor. This should allow me to quickly create complex and flexible dialogs.
